# IReport
Report writing application with SQL SERVER as backend, using C#, Xamarin, MVVM design pattern and SOLID principles.
I created this app from scratch.   Xamarin.Essentials and Xamarin.Forms are the only nuget packages included.  
No ORM frameworks like Entity and no MVVM helpers like Prism.  I learned and completed my first application completely from scratch.  
The next application I will build, iClock, will use popular nuget packages and frameworks like Prism, Entity and Moq.  
iClock will be created using TDD (Test Driven Development.)

Follow me on this adventure.  Together we will make iClock, a mobile application for iOS and android that will allow employees to clock in and out, keep track of their hours and pay, and will allow employers to manipulate this data, add tasks and monitor the completion of these tasks by recieving notifications each time a task is marked complete by an employee.
